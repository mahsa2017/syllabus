## Functions

### Why Functions?

The function is considered one of the greatest inventions in computer science.
It makes programs easier to read and to understand. It allows for us to more
easily modify and extend code. It saves space and improves performance.

At the most basic level, a function is a series of instructions that can take an
input and produce an output. Parameters dictate how the function behaves.

We've used functions a bit, but now we need to know how to use them well.

There are many ways to write code that does the same thing. But are they all
equal?

> code. What could we do to improve it?

```js
function printHelloFiveTimes() {
  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

> Exercise: write an improved version of this function

Now, let's look at a different example. Let's say we wanted to welcome mentors:

```js
function welcomeMentors() {
  console.log("Hello Mozafar");
  console.log("Hello Rares");
  console.log("Hello Tim");
  console.log("Hello Ashleigh");
  console.log("Hello Gordon");
}
```

We could be lazy and change how we welcome the mentors.

```js
function welcomeMentors() {
  var mentorNames = "Mozafar, Rares, Tim, Ashleigh, Gordon";
  console.log("Hello " + mentorNames);
}
```

But it's not quite the output we wanted. And we can be smarter about it. Why not
a loop?

So functions help us to organise and enhance our code. But what makes good
design? Is it just "shorter is always better"?

## Good Design

Design is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other
humans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.

There are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and
extensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these
three.

* Ease of Maintenance / Clarity
  * Naming
  * Commenting
  * Clear logic
  * Concise
  * Formatting
  * Avoiding Redundancy

* Reusability
  * DRY
  * Single Reponsibility
    * Avoiding global state (scope)
    * Predictability and Ease of testing

* Extensibility
  * Avoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)

Now let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function

```js
function myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {
  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;
  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;
  var originalSalary = salary;
  var nationalInsurance = null;

  if (taxCode === "1150L") {
    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;
  } else if (taxCode === "ST") {
    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;
  } else {
    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;
  }

  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];

  salary = salary - deductions[0];
  salary = salary - deductions[1];
  salary = salary - deductions[2];

  return (
    "Your gross income is £" +
    originalSalary.toString() +
    " and your net income is £" +
    salary.toString() +
    "."
  );
}

console.log(myFunction(28000, "1150L", 1000, 580, false));
```

What is wrong with this function?

1. Naming: the function has a bad name, myFunction() tells you nothing about
   what the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables
   vaguely by separating them through numbers (incomeTax1, incomeTax2, etc). If
   you find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as
   incomeTax[]).

2. Commenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to
   understand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code
   contributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their
   reasoning and helps the function be human readable.

3. Layout/formatting: unnecessary spacing between the if and else statement.

4. Single responsibility: the function doesn't have a single purpose. It
   calculates national insurance and salary deductions. Maybe the national
   insurance calculation could be moved to a separate function.

5. Input variable being overwritten: the function requires gross salary (before
   deductions) and net salary (after deductions) the `salary` input variable is
   therefore copied into an `originalSalary` variable so that it can be changed.
   It would be much clearer to create a new `netSalary` variable and leave
   `salary` unmodified.

6. DRY principle: the function validates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.
   The line where a deduction is taken from the salary is repeated 3 times with
   different indices. This can be replaced with a `for` loop.

7. Magic numbers. The code contains a lot of magic numbers, including `17775`,
   `0.09` and `0.1`.

8. Useless parameters: the code contains a variable which isn't used. They
   should be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're
   starting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might
   need them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.

## TDD

## Unit Testing

Testing is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our
software is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure
our programs behave like we intend them to do - **if we don't test, we can cause
severe bugs**. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users
of your software really frustrated.

There are different levels on which we can test software, for example
integration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal
with unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.

A unit test is exactly that - it tests a _unit_ of code. "Unit" can mean
different things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.

Remember when we talked about functions? Functions take _input_ (as arguments),
do something with it (in the function body), and return _output_ (using the
`return` statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if
the same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what
we want!

```
         |-----------------|
input => | doing something | => output
         |-----------------|
```

So, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that _for a certain
input, we get the expected output_. For this we need to make sure that the
output matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an
equality check:

```js
myFunction(input) === expectedOutput;
```

We can formalise this using another function that compares two values and
complains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in
`unit-testing/equals.js`.

We can use this function to simply compare to values:

```js
equals(1, 1); // This should pass
equals(1, 2); // This should fail
equals("Hello", "Hello"); // This should pass
```

Now we can use this `equals()` function to test our own code by comparing a
function result to an expected value.

Remember that one function can be used as an argument when a second function is called. In this instance, the function we are testing would represent our first function, and our `equals()` function would represent the second, like so...

```js
equals(myNewFunction(arg1, arg2, etc), expectedOutput)
```
As you can see in this example, instead of using a number as the first argument to the `equals()` function, we have used a function instead; the one we wish to test.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on
> the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into
> very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests,
> only. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))

A key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we
dive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?

We formalise those requirements by writing tests - _even before our program is
written_! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any
code yet. Our tests are now **RED** (the colour represents a failing test).

Now we want to turn this **RED** into **GREEN**. We do this by implementing our
function in a way that covers all our test cases.

> _Exercise:_ Follow the instructions in `tdd/findNeedle.js`!

## Refactoring

There are times when we want to make our code better without changing any
functionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a
certain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called
_refactoring_.

When previously **GREEN** code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,
we call this a _regression_. Our existing tests can make sure that when we
refactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not
regress.

> _Together:_ Refactor the `findNeedle` function we just wrote to be implemented
> using `.map()` and `.filter()`.

## Unit testing frameworks

There are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being
equal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if
a function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before
another thing, or how long a function call took to execute.

We don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are _unit
testing frameworks_ that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do
is provide the code and the tests.

### Jest

The unit testing framework we are trying today is called
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). It's created by Facebook and useful
for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a
later lesson).

Look into your `jest/` folder. You will find a file there, `sum.test.js`. The
suffix `.test.js` tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To
execute the test, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm test
```

This command runs the test in `sum.test.js`, which tests the `sum()` function.
You can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.

Tests cases in Jest have the following structure:

```js
test("test description", function() {
  // Test instructions
});
```

Jest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests.
They are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:

```
_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3
```

becomes

```js
expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
```

You can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one
call of the `test` function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one
file. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.

> _Exercise:_ Add another test case to `sum.test.js`. Is the sum of 10 and -10
> really zero? Run the tests using Jest.

> _Exercise:_ Take the `findNeedle` function you have tested previously, copy it
> into the `jest/` folder and call it `findNeedle.test.js`. Then write a test to
> be used with Jest, similar to `sum.test.js`. Make sure you cover multiple
> inputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.

### Test coverage

Test coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest
runs your tests, it generates a so-called _coverage report_. This report tells
you how many of your _lines of code_ are covered by tests, how many functions,
statements, and branches.

> A branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if
> you have an `if() ... else ...`, both the "if" and the "else" branch must be
> covered by tests.

We want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to
generate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage
```

> _Exercise:_ Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the
> numbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!
